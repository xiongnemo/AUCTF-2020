The point of this challenge is to teach how to find information using the FCC databases.
One method of solving this is to find: https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/General_Menu_Reports/engineering_search.cfm?accessible=NO
Searching for AL, Lee county, and "First Transit" as the Licensee Name and checking the wildcard box will show the FCC entry on Tiger Transit.
Looking through this entry will reveal 3 allocations: 2 on 462.025 and 1 on 467.025
462.025 is the frequency used by the buses, so the flag is auctf{462.025}

A much easier method is to Google "auburn tiger transit radio frequency". The first result is https://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?ctid=41
