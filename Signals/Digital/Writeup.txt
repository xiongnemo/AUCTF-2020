The .wav file contains a audio of some digital sounding thing. This actually a BPSK63 recording of the flag.
The flag is encoded with BPSK63. BPSK is a common digital mode for amateur radio operators, a method for sending digital data over an analog (audio) radio.
63 refers to the bit rate and bandwidth, and can be recognized if the signal can be viewed on a waterfall plot.
Digital modes can also be identified by how they sound, similar to how most people can recognize the sound of a dial-up modem. The sound of the .wav file can be compared to samples on-line. http://www.w1hkj.com/FldigiHelp-3.21/Modes/index.htm is a good library of HAM/amateur radio digital modes.
FLDIGI is my software of choice for digital modes, but there are other programs that can do the same thing.
In FLDIGI, setting the mode to BPSK63 and playing back the .wav file will reveal the flag: auctf{bigger_number_equals_more_better}
