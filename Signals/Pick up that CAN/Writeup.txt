The flag is embedded within CAN bus packets as hexiddecimal values that 
	correspond to ASCII characters.
There are 3 ID numbers of interest: 3, 4, and 5. The can-util package can be 
	used to play back the log and observe the packets in a human-readable format.
canplayer is used for playback and cansniffer is used for observation.
To use these, a CAN interface must be set up. The provided bash script creates 
	an interface called vcan0.
Executing "cansniffer vcan0" after setting up the interface starts the 
	observation.
Executing "canplayer -I <log filename> vcan0=can0" starts replaying the CAN 
	traffic on the vcan0 interface*.
cansniffer should now start displaying CAN ID numbers that change, the current 
	data on them, and the ASCII decoded version.
In the ASCII section of the screen, the flag should appear near the top.
The flag is: auctf{ImTheTrashMan}



*This is different from the normal sender-receiver protocols such as TCP/IP as 
	the only "address" on each packet is the ID number. cansniffer lists each
	ID number on a single line, followed by the most recent data sent with that
	ID. If an ID does not get any new data, it will dissapear from the screen.
	By default, it takes 5 seconds of no updates, but the -t flag can be used
	with cansniffer to change this.
